## An experiment in neural network rendering.

This started as an idea to create a 4D block of "time" containing 3d life forms.
It is an attempt to visualise life as a continous process, with each entity
being part of a larger 4D structure through time, in a physical sense.

For now it is something more simple, renderings of 2D entities over time via a
simple 3D space.
